  <h3>Home, Digital Image,2018</h3>
  <p>This piece was inspired by what reminds me of home. One of the very few trees I see in my school and when I get home is a Jacaranda Tree.
    I absolutly love it because it is usually green during the fall and winter, but in the spring time the trees turn into a beautiful lavender purple.
  I made the tree into a glitch looking like a rainbow because the tree reminds me of the beauty the world brings.</p>

   <h3>Gentrification, Digital Image, 2018</h3>
   <p>This image was inspired by the things that are going on in my hometown, Los Angeles.
     I wanted to include how there are cities that are home to alot of minorities, which are now being gentrified my white America.
     I usually know gentrification is occuring when a surplus of Starbucks' are being built in almost every other cornor street.
   It is a sad thing that happens, but is going to continue to occur in America as long as it keeps growing.</p>

 <h3>Tornado Warning, Digital Sound, 1:00, 2018</h3>
 <p>This sound was incorporates tornado warning sirens, bird chirping, shoe scraping, and thunder sounds. These sounds were inspired by the natural
 disasters that happen all around the world. I wanted to convey how an ordinary day can turn into a life changing catastrophe.</p>

     <h3>Everyday, Interactive Net Art using p5.js, 2018</h3>
     <p>While figuring out what I wanted to do for this project I simply started making happy faces. I realized that alot of time people
     put on a facade. People always look like they are happy when in reality deep down most people aren't happy. This project was inspired
   by that and how everyday we put on a face smile</p>

      <h3>Welcome Home, Digital Sound, 3:17, 2018</h3>
      <p>The concept I chose for the project is based on gentrification. I based it on my experience with it where I live (Los Angeles, California),
 but also how it seems to be happening all around the country.I thought,through an artist's perspective, that it would challenging, yet interesting
 coming up sounds to convey gentrification. </p>
